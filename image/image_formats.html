  <h1>Forms of Images</h1>

  <h2>PNG Files</h2>
  <p> PNG files or Portable Network Graphic are best used for the web. They offer a color and transperancy than GIFs do. On the other hand, while it does give you a better looking image, the file size compared to the other two can be much larger which can make some users trying to view your website take ages to see it.</p>

  <h2>JPEG Files</h2>
  <p> JPEG files are most commonly found and used and best for photography and images that contain different effects. The file size of JPEGs are equal to, or in some cases smaller than GIF images.</p>


  <h2>GIF Files</h2>
  <p> As well as being able to be animated, GIFs are best for images with flatter colors with no shading. However, GIFs are restricted to only 256 colors. This can be limiting to some kinds of pictures. Any pictures with large amounts of solid color with little to no shading looks best in GIF format.</p>
