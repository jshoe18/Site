  <h2>Citizenship-"The character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/citizenship</p>


  <h2>Honesty-"Truthfulness, sincerity, or frankness."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Defintion from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/honesty?s=t</p>
  <p>Honesty is a key aspect of good citizenship because without it, there can be no trust between two people because neither one will know whether or not the other is lying.</p>

  <h2>Compassion-"A feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/compassion?s=t</p>
  <p>Compassion can be an important trait for some people, but it isn't very important in terms of citzenship because people do not have to feel bad for everyone they see in a bad situation.</p>

  <h2>Respect-"Esteem for or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/respect?s=</p>
  <p>Respect is on of the most important traits a person can have and is important for good citzenship. Without respect, there is just hate.</p>

  <h2>Responsibility-"The state or fact of being responsible, answerable, or accountable for something within one's power, control, or management."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/responsibility?s=t</p>
  <p>Responsibility is important. Everyone must be able to do tasks that they are given whether this is going to a job or voting for members of the government.</p>

  <h2>Courage-"The quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear; bravery."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/courage?s=t</p>
  <p>While courage is not a important quality for citizenship, it can be a very important trait for a leader of some sort to have. This isn't as important because not everyone is capable of going into a situation without fear.</p>

  <h2>Tolerance-"A fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, beliefs, practices, racial or ethnic origins, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry."</h2>
  <p style="font-size:50%;">Definition from http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tolerance?s=t</p>
  <p>Tolerance is important quality for a good citizen because not everyone's ideas and beliefs are the same so everyone should be able to accept other's ideas even if they do not personally believe in them. This allows there to be better communication between people.</p>


  <p>Recently I witnessed someone going into a local church to deliver food to a food bank. This is a good example of citizenship because this person was showing respect and compassion. By giving food to someone in need, they are showing that they care for the well-being of someone else even if they do not know the person.</p>
